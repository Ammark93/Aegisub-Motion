	\section{Preamble}
  There have been a huge number of changes to the way this script operates since the last ``version'' was released. I have also decided to separate the sections on mocha usage into their own manual.
  
  While I'd like to believe that the usage of this script is pretty self explanatory, there are many things that have been added that cannot simply be discovered from the interface. The code in the script itself is definitely not laid out in the most understandable fashion, so I think it's only fair that a comprehensive explanation should be made. This manual is intended to cover, from start to finish, the order that the script is intended to be used.
  
	\section*{Acknowledgements}
	I'd like to thank \textbackslash{}fake, \_\_ar, Hale, delamoo, nullx, zanget, Sutai, tophf and tp7 for their assistance, technical or otherwise, in writing this script. I'd also like to thank jfs and Plorkyeran (among others) for all the work they've done on Aegisub.
