Currently, only position works. Scale and Rotation are in progress. 
Once they are done, I will actually explain how to use it.

This script is a horrible amalgam of duct tape, ugly string matching and generally all around terrible code. 
If for some reason you actually want to use it, feel free to contact me on rizon.
