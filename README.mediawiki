If you are applying scale data, you can also optionally choose to scale border and shadow (on by default).

''Scaled output will only display properly when played back with libass. VSfilter only accepts integer values for scale.''
This issue may or may not be dealt with later.

 <nowiki>This script is a horrible amalgam of duct tape, ugly string matching and generally all around terrible code.
 If for some reason you actually want to use it, feel free to contact me on rizon.</nowiki>
