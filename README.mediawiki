This is the unstable branch of aegisub-motion.

What does that mean? Well, we've got a whole lot of new features, and the user interface was somewhat “rewritten” to be Less Retarded™.

Unfinished/untested features:
*Move \i?clip() with position (suggested by tophf)
*Possibly fixed rotation handling maybe!
*Exporting your data for graphing with gnuplot! Kind of!

“Implemented” features (prone to not work right or at all):
*Clicking on the labels next to checkboxes now checks the checkboxes! Much less mouse-eye coordination required! Great for those of you with Parkinson's Disease!
*Linear output! For when you don't see a good reason to make a sign span 400 lines in your script when the same effect can be achieved in one line!
*Cleaner output, probably! Removal of redundant tags and finished transforms from tracked lines!
*No more mutilation of \clip!
*Information gathering made into a more distributed clusterfuck!
*A slightly larger memory footprint!
*Progress bars! Bitches love progress bars, right?
*Much more likely to crash without any explanation!
*An outdated readme that will potentially be rewritten! Probably!
*Automatically generate trimmed avisynth script and automagically encode it (suggested by tp7)

I don't test this branch before pushing commits, so don't expect it to work.

The last stable version is [https://github.com/torque/aegisub-motion/tree/master still available]. It's not perfect, but at least it works. Mostly (note: I don't think rotation works right).

If you do use this script, and you have suggestions/requests, '''''tell me about them'''''!
