===Now on v0.1.lessbad!===

====Fancy New Features!====

*Accepting pasted data as an alternative to a filepath.
*Support for \t() transformations, and support for \fad() (by converting it to a transform).
*Writing configuration to the script header (more or less to create temporary defaults).
*A potentially more flexible parser. Maybe.
*Other, even more ambitious things that were deimplemented because they were on the path to miserable failure.
*Even more painfully horrible code!

And probably there weren't even any regressions that I immediately noticed!

====Fancy Planned Features!====

*Support for \fade().
*Support for moving \clip() and \iclip() with position (at least rectangular).
*A nice function that cleans up generated lines.
*Possibly adding some really hacky gnuplot integration.

====Things This Can't Do for You:====

Nothing!
