Position and scale seem to work as expected.<br>Rotation has had no testing, and will not until I have an actual reason to test it. Your mileage may vary.

'''''A VSfilter compatibility mode has been implemented for allowing VSfilter to work with scale data. It helps to stabilize the way vsfilter renders non-integer scale values, but libASS's rendering job is still superior. Also, as it uses a lot of staged transforms, I have no idea how much it increases the rendering cost. I'm guessing a fair amount.'''''

This script is a horrible amalgam of duct tape, ugly string matching and generally all around terrible code.<br>I am currently working on documentation for it that will hopefully explain how to actually use it, but I don't know when I'll be finished with that.<br>If for some reason you actually want to use it, feel free to contact me on rizon.
