This is the volatile branch. I made this branch because I wanted to be able to attempt to mass-implement new features without worrying about horribly breaking the working version of the script.

As its name implies this is "unstable" and odds are it won't work. Once I've actually tested the new features and worked out the bugs, I will merge it with the master.
