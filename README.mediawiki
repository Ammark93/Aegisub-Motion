Hey there, buddy! If you're reading this, then that means you're probably looking at the next iteration of aegisub-motion!

What does that mean? Well, we've got a whole lot of new features, and the user interface was somewhat "rewritten" to be Less Retardedâ„¢.

*Clicking on the labels next to checkboxes now checks the checkboxes! Much less mouse-eye coordination required! Great for those of you with Parkinson's Disease!
*Linear output! For when you don't see a good reason to make a sign span 400 lines in your script when the same effect can be achieved in one!
*Exporting your data for graphing with gnuplot! Kind of!
*Cleaner output, probably! Removal of redundant tags and finished transforms from tracked lines!
*No more mutilation of \clip!
*Information gathering made into a more distributed clusterfuck!
*A slightly larger memory footprint!
*Progress bars! Bitches love progress bars, right?
*Much more likely to crash without any explanation!
*An outdated readme that will potentially be rewritten! Probably!

To clarify, this is the development branch (hurr hurr) of aegisub-motion and as such, is likely to be unstable and bug-riddled, if it even works at all. I don't usually check to make sure the script compiles before pushing commits, the way I do with the master branch, so odds are you might not be able to run it. Well, what can you do about it? You can bitch at me to push a working version, which is usually reasonably fast. Of course, since I've gotten exactly 0 constructive feedback on this project thus far, I doubt things will come to that. Otherwise, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

But if you do use it, and you have suggestions/requests, '''''tell me about them'''''!
