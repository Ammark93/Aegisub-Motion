Position and scale work, but have had minimal testing. I have added rotation support, but I have yet to test it, and it will probably be a long time before I do, so YMMV.

'''''Scaled output will only display properly when played back with libass. VSfilter only accepts integer values for scale.'''''<br>This issue may or may not be dealt with later (If I can be bothered with staged transforms).

This script is a horrible amalgam of duct tape, ugly string matching and generally all around terrible code.<br>If for some reason you actually want to use it, feel free to contact me on rizon.
