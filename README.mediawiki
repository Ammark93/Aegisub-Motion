Welcome to the future.

What does that mean? Well, we've got a whole lot of new features, and the user interface was somewhat “rewritten” to be Less Retarded™.

Unfinished features:
*Exporting your data for graphing with gnuplot (need to test with non-720p resolutions and finish writing the gnuplot command)
*Different organization of tracked lines (sorting by frame suggested by tophf)
*Writing config file to disk
*Rewritten

Newly “Implemented” features (mostly tested and mostly working):
*Clicking on the labels next to checkboxes now checks the checkboxes! Much less mouse-eye coordination required! Great for those of you with Parkinson's Disease!
*Linear output! For when you don't see a good reason to make a sign span 400 lines in your script when the same effect can be achieved in one line!
*Cleaner output, probably! Removal of redundant tags and finished transforms from tracked lines. (planning to expand on this a bit)
*No more mutilation of \clip!
*Information gathering made into a more distributed clusterfuck!
*A slightly larger memory footprint!
*Progress bars! Bitches love progress bars, right? (Even better, they're actually worthless and typically move too fast to be noticed (unless you have logging on)).
*Move \i?clip() with position—does ''not'' scale (subject to change) (suggested by tophf)
*Possibly fixed rotation handling maybe! (Actually I did a few more tests and the rotation seems okay? I'd need proof otherwise, at least.)
*Gathers default position via karaskel so \pos is no longer necessary (but still recommended).
*Automatically generate trimmed avisynth script and automagically encode it (suggested by tp7)
*Automagic “Upscaling” or “downscaling” of the tracking data to match the script header resolution (no more warnings about this; assumes a PAR of 1)
*Separation of \frz and \org handling
*Spits out “memory usage” (which seems to be somewhat arbitrary) if your log level is high enough (Still haven't figured out the cause of the “out of memory” runtime error).
*No longer comments lines out when canceled.
*Nearing 1000 loc. I never expected this to become this huge.

The current version seems to work for most things.

If you do use this script, and you have suggestions/requests, '''''tell me about them'''''!
