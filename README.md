Yarr, laddy, ye've stumbled upon thar legacy branch of this haar code.

This is where the versions that still support Aegisub 2.1.x will be kept from now on. This code will see maintenance (if necessary), but no new features will be added. If I do end up writing documentation for it, it'll be _after_ the current version's is finished.
