This is the fancy new branch for the fancy new features, as well as reducing some of the bloat I introduced to the script over time.

This branch is not guaranteed to be stable at any time. If you want something that (mostly) works, see [master](https://github.com/torque/Aegisub-Motion/tree/master).

done:

 - independent clip motion
 - arbitrary start frame, rather than just first or last.

todo:

 - multiple override block per line support
 - add the clip stuff to the config
 - autostart mocha via command line for love and peace
 - manual file saving
 - I'm considering throwing out the 2.1.X compatability code because it's kinda annoying, and I don't care much about 2.1.X at this point.
